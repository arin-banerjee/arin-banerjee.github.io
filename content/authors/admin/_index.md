      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am experienced in innovative technical consulting, research and development, statistical modelling, systems design, and application development. Currently, I work at EY as a Manager - AI Consulting with a passion for turning raw data into products, actionable insights, and meaningful stories. I lead several cross-geographical client engagements and deliveries in analytics and AI. 

My substantial involvement in the innovation labs and CoEs has formed my instinct for innovation. I have filed ten patents till now. 

I am comfortable in manipulating and analyzing massive, complex, high-dimensional data from heterogeneous sources. I have architected and deployed data-driven AI pipelines to cater to both data and AI requirements of the business and to help organizations succeed in their data endeavors without getting caught up in the hype. I have the ability to succeed in both collaborative and independent work environments with strong communication and data presentation skills to effectively communicate with both business and technical teams.
